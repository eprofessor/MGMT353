                In Part 1-Reflecting Friedman lists the  3 factors that are driving rapid change in today's world. Technology, Globalization and Climate Change. 
            In Part 2-Accelerating, he begins to explore and discuss these factors in more detail, breaking them down into 4 major concepts. As proof that change driven by improvemnts in technology is occuring quickly, he provides examples of nine major innovations that have begun the acceleration process.

                The Human Adaptation Rate, the rate at which we as humans can adpat to a new technology, was down from 3 generations (100 years) in the year 1000 to 1 generation by the year 1900.

On page 34, in discussing human adaptability and the rate of change of technology, Friedman states that by 'learning faster and governing smarter' we as a society can bridge the gap. But this is at best a temporary solution. As time moves to the right, the gap between Human Adaptability and Technology increases again.
                <br>
