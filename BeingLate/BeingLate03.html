                <li>Life-long learning used to be a luxury, now it is a necessity</li>

                <li>businesses will pay for in-demand, high functioning skills, any low-level skill is at risk of being automated</li>
                <li>some companies such as AT&amp;T equate life-long learner with life-long employee</li>

                <li>interdependencies between the United States/Europe/China/Russia</li>

                <li>Negative liberty (freedom from violence) versus Positive liberty (freedom to pursue happiness)</li>
                <li>Social media and real change (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_let_s_design_social_media_that_drives_real_change" class="bg-info text-white" target="_blank">Wael Ghonim and the Arab Spring</a>) </li>

            <p>Mother Nature as Political Mentor </p>
            <p>
                Friedman considers how lessons from Mother Nature can be applied to solve seemingly intractable political problems.<br>
                He discusses concepts such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>using biomimicry to address water shortages with a self-filling water bottle</li>

                <li>does culture define society (conservatism)? or</li>
                <li>does society through politics change culture (liberalism)?</li>
                <li>benefits of being adaptive (Japan 1850-1900) (China 1840-1970 and beyond) versus not adapting (Russia post 1989)</li>
                <li>diversity spurs economic development </li>
                <li>the benefits of ownership focused cultures</li>
                <li>the need to modify US federalism to incentivize local innovation that promotes ownership</li>

            <p>Is God in CyberSpace?</p>
            <p>
                Friedman considers issues of religion, morality, right versus wrong and the implications of free will.
            <br>
                He also touches on what happens when humans are taken out of the loop and beer ads are served up with ISIS recruitment videos.<br>
                How do you deal with ethical issues when cyberspace is a virtual place that humans cannot easily control, and AIs are not yet powerful enough to navigate?<br>
                Some things to consider are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>as a global society will we embrace the power to kill all things on the planet, or use this power to solve problems?</li>
                <li>how do you incorporate AI or algorithms to prevent ethical issues like Uber surge pricing?</li>
                <li>what are the ethical issues of using '<a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/2328070/what-parents-need-to-know-about-ghost-apps-used-to-hide-sexts/" class="bg-info text-white" target="_blank">Ghost Apps</a>'?</li>
                <li>laws are necessary but not sufficient to stop cyber criminals, how do you promote trust and respect in society?</li>
                <li>how do you promote peaceful cooperation instead of violent competition?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we want a just and sustainable world then we need a society composed of individuals raised in caring family environments that are part of a strong community which is ready to embrace the world.</p>
