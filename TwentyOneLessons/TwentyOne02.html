            <p>
                Technological advances are changing our world at a rate never before experienced.
            </p>

            <p>
                The twin revolutions in information technology and biotechnology confront us with the biggest challenges our species has ever encountered.
                <br />
                The merger of infotech and biotech threatens the core modern values of liberty and equality.<br />
                Any solution to the technological challenge has to involve global cooperation.<br />
                But nationalism, religion and culture divide humankind into hostile camps and make it very difficult to cooperate on a global level.

            </p>

            <p>
                Human evolution and physiology has placed a limit of approximatey 150 meaningful relationships on an individual.<br />
                Building communities takes time and effort by all parties involved.<br />
                Technology is allowing the creation of massive online communities.<br />
                Reflect on the merging of online and offline communities.

            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                What safeguards, if any, are needed, to prevent the manipulation of our entire bodies in a way that protects individual liberty while maintaining robust offline community?

                6. (50) Civilization
            </p>

            <p>
                Humans of any era tend to re-write history to their current mood.<br />
                Several examples are noted in this chapter.<br />
                The current global political paradigm is based on the accepted principles of human rights, state sovereignty, and international law.<br />
                This situation has resulted in world stability, best epitomized by the universal veneration of the American dollar.<br />
                Science and medicine has become more trusted for answers to problems.<br />
                Today we all participate in a global civilization, but there are still disagreements.<br />
                               
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                How many civilizations currently exist on our planet?

                7. (50) Nationalism
            </p>

            <p>
                The current threats to human civilization-nuclear war, ecological collapse and technological disruption-pose an existential crisis.<br />
                Worse yet, their interdependencies may create a whole other set of problems.<br />
                Nationalism, and returning to the world of the past, does not hold the answer.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                What is needed to resolve our current set of unprecedented global predicaments?<br />

                8. (50) Religion
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past thousand years the focus of religion has shifted from solving problems to providing interpretations and justifying positions.<br />
                Science now provides us with answers to technical questions, such as curing diseases like measles.<br />
                The science of economics provides the same answers for all religions.<br />
                Religion can still effectively unite a country, witness the changes in Japan from 1853 to 1941.<br />
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                What role can religion play today in solving the world's probems?<br />

                9. (50) Immigration
            </p>

            <p>
                Differences between current societies such as England and India are far less than they were one thousand years ago.<br />
                But cultural differences still exist.<br />
                People have been moving to better themselves .<br />
                Issues of assimilation, tolerance, changes to the national identity all bear on the resolution of the problems.<br />
                Racism can easily be mistaken for culturism.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
                What is the current situation with regard to immigration and assimilation of refugees in Europe?<br />
